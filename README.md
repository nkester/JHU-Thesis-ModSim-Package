# `{modSim}`

This package contains the functions required for my thesis work "Applying trade-space analysis to modeling and simulation as a service (MSaaS): A Study in applying established systems engineering methodologies in a novel setting."

This function is not meant to be general and re-useable as many of the functions are purpose built for this work. That said, there are some utility functions that have re-use potential. In fact, some have been re-used here from work I have done in the past.
